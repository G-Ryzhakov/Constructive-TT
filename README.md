# Code for Constructive TT approximation

This is repository with code and examples for the paper ``Constructive TT-representation of the tensors given as index interaction functions with applications''

To run exiprements one needs to install dependeces first:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

and install ttgames
```
git clone https://github.com/rballester/ttgames.git
cd ttgames
pip install .
```

The examples are in the `ipynb` files and do not require additional installations.
